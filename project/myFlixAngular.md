An Angular app using a self-made API to display information of a handful of anime movies through the use of directives, data binding, and interpolation. Register and log in to access the movies and their details (i.e. directors and genres). Users can add movies to their list of favorites for quick access and also manage and update their account details.

WARNING: Due to the removal of Heroku's free dynos, you cannot register/login to this application. Will find a fix/substitute for this soon.
